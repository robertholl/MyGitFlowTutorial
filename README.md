# My Git and Git Flow Tutorial

## Background

I have been dabbling off and on for several months using git and see the value, but since I haven't been able to continue to use Git on a regular basis, it becomes difficult to maintain a working knowledge.  In addition, I have found it difficult to improve my Git skills since I have not found a simple active project to contribute on in order to get more of the developer team environment feel.  The goal of this approach is to document my step by step approach to learning how to use Git (while using git along the way) and hopefully add a Git Flow workflow twist eventually to this project.
